      <description>Introducing the Over-Engineered Resume A common question that comes up when a developer is fresh out of college and looking for experience is, &amp;ldquo;How can I show off a project when I haven&amp;rsquo;t done anything outside of school?&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s a valid question, and one that we all had to face at one point. How do you get that first bit of experience to get you going?

      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introducing-the-over-engineered-resume&#34;&gt;Introducing the Over-Engineered Resume&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common question that comes up when a developer is fresh out of college and looking for experience is, &amp;ldquo;How can I show off a project when I haven&amp;rsquo;t done anything outside of school?&amp;rdquo;
It&amp;rsquo;s a valid question, and one that we all had to face at one point. How do you get that first bit of experience to get you going?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-first-project&#34;&gt;The First Project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone needs a &amp;ldquo;first&amp;rdquo; project. Something you can dive into, learn new things with, and something to show off your coding style. Or build one, if you&amp;rsquo;re new to programming. My first project was a portfolio. I wanted something to show off the work that I would eventually do, and I needed something to put on github (it seemed really important to me at the time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, a decade later, I still recommend people build their own portfolio or resume. It&amp;rsquo;s a useful project to have, and I can&amp;rsquo;t count the amount of interviews I&amp;rsquo;ve been in where the team really doesn&amp;rsquo;t know how to gauge a developer to see how they would work with their team, so it&amp;rsquo;s helpful to have something to dive into with a development team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-resume&#34;&gt;The Resume&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re going to be building out a resume. Simple enough, yeah? Well, in premise, yes. The goal of a resume is simply to give an overview of your experience and skillset, and to start a conversation with a team to see if you can be productive together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project will do more than list a few keywords and try to convince a recruiter that you can bring value to their clients. I want something I can show off. I want a set of code I can be proud of to put on my public github profile. I need something I can use to play with new tech. Ever see a new tool and think &amp;ldquo;I wish I had something I could use that in&amp;rdquo;? Why not take something simple and completely over-engineer it instead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-plan&#34;&gt;The Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be building out the Over-Engineered Resume in a series of blog posts. I&amp;rsquo;ll be using the project to demonstrate techniques that I use in my work. Follow along, and show off your skills with me!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Background I&amp;rsquo;m studying for the CompTIA Network+ N10-008 exam. There&amp;rsquo;s a LOT of material, so I&amp;rsquo;ll use this page to organize notes on what I used to study, how I went about it, and helpful charts I&amp;rsquo;ll use to memorize the needful.
When I was in high school, I took a Cisco certification course. We offered it as an elective at our school to try to get more kids into tech.</description>
      <content>&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m studying for the CompTIA Network+ N10-008 exam. There&amp;rsquo;s a LOT of material, so I&amp;rsquo;ll
use this page to organize notes on what I used to study, how I went about it, and
helpful charts I&amp;rsquo;ll use to memorize the needful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was in high school, I took a Cisco certification course. We offered it as an elective at our school to
try to get more kids into tech. It took a whole year for the Networking 1 and 2 class, and at the end, you were supposedly able to
take your CCNA and go on to be a network tech right out of high school. The course wasn&amp;rsquo;t great, but I did learn to configure a router,
build patch cables, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also moved into a house with no previous network infrastructure last year, so I had the joy of running cable through walls and my attic already,
terminating ends and testing all my connections. I&amp;rsquo;m building a Lack Rack at the moment to host my patch panel, router, switch, and other goodies that make up my home network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;materials&#34;&gt;Materials&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No links seen here are affiliate links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/CompTIA-Network-Guide-Sixth-N10-006/dp/0071848223/&#34;&gt;All-In-One Network+ Book&lt;/a&gt; - Mike Meyers - I used the N10-006 version because it was only $8 used, and I&amp;rsquo;ll make up the updated info by buying Meyers&amp;rsquo; Udemy course
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.udemy.com/course/total-comptia-network-n10-008/&#34;&gt;TOTAL: CompTIA Network+ (N10-008)&lt;/a&gt; - Mike Meyers, Joe Ramm - For those that don&amp;rsquo;t like
to read, you can listen to the soothing voices of Mike Meyers and Joe Ramm whisper sweet subnetting into your ears. This is basically just a narration of the Network+ book.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-network-008-exams/&#34;&gt;CompTIA Network+ (N10-008) 6 Practice Exams&lt;/a&gt; - Jason Dion
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.professormesser.com/network-plus/n10-008/n10-008-video/n10-008-training-course/&#34;&gt;Professor Messer&amp;rsquo;s CompTIA N10-008 Network+ Course&lt;/a&gt; - Professor Messer offers a free video training course. He goes in a different order than Meyers, so I&amp;rsquo;m saving his stuff for after Meyers&amp;rsquo; training
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/user/sunnylearning/videos&#34;&gt;Sunny Learning&lt;/a&gt; - Sunny has some interesting information on his channel and explains in a way that is easy to work with. Check out his &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecCuyq-Wprc&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Subnetting Is Simple&amp;rdquo; video&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ankiweb.net/&#34;&gt;Anki&lt;/a&gt; - Anki is open-source software that helps you memorize things with flash cards. I found &lt;a href=&#34;https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/161585723&#34;&gt;this Network+ Starter Set deck&lt;/a&gt; and will be using these cards until I develop my own, based on what I&amp;rsquo;m lagging behind in. I may not need to make my own, we&amp;rsquo;ll see how the practice exams go.

&lt;p&gt;Note: The Udemy courses sound expensive until you browse the Udemy site for a little while. Their courses go on &amp;ldquo;sale&amp;rdquo;, and the courses that all say they&amp;rsquo;re $100-200 are actually about $12 or so at other times. I paid $13 for the two Udemy courses, and at the time I&amp;rsquo;m writing this post to grab links, they&amp;rsquo;re on sale for $9.99. Don&amp;rsquo;t get impatient, just give it a week if they&amp;rsquo;re not on sale right now. Start with the book anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;strategy&#34;&gt;Strategy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way I learn best is to read, then think about or discuss what I&amp;rsquo;ve read, then put it into practice. With the materials I&amp;rsquo;ve got available,
I&amp;rsquo;m reading a chapter in the All In One book, then watching the corresponding video in Meyers&amp;rsquo; video course. This helps me to hear it explained, sometimes in a different way, and helps me to solidify what I&amp;rsquo;ve read. Once I&amp;rsquo;ve made it through the book and videos, I&amp;rsquo;ll take a practice exam and see how I do. If I make above a 70%, I&amp;rsquo;ll go ahead and schedule my exam for 1 month out and continue my studies. If I make below a 70%, I&amp;rsquo;ll schedule it for 2 months out. The test isn&amp;rsquo;t cheap, so I only want to have to take it once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I&amp;rsquo;ll go through the exam objectives and see if there&amp;rsquo;s anywhere I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m lacking. Based on where I did poorly on the practice exams, I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on areas I felt weakest. It may help to go through some of Professor Messer&amp;rsquo;s videos and Sunny&amp;rsquo;s videos on some topics as well. Every week leading up to the exam, I&amp;rsquo;ll take a practice exam to develop a rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;
